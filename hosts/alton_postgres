  │ The PostgreSQL version 13 is obsolete, but the server or client packages are still installed. Please install the latest packages (postgresql-14 and postgresql-client-14) and upgrade the existing  clusters with pg_upgradecluster    │

  │ Please be aware that the installation of postgresql-14 will automatically create a default cluster 14/main. If you want to upgrade the 13/main cluster, you need to remove the already existing 14 cluster (pg_dropcluster --stop 14   │  
  │ main, see manpage for details).                                                                                                                                                                                                        │
