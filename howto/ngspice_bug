I just hit this too. It happens if you try to install ngspice with kicad installed.

It seems kicad can actually use the standard libngspice0 package, so the workaround is to

apt install --mark-auto libngspice0
apt install ngspice

I wonder why kicad needs its custom package. Maybe it should prefer libngspice0.
